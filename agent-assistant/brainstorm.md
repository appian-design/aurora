# Agent Workflow Brainstorming

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Automate design system documentation generation using AI agents to create comprehensive SAIL component guidance for designer review.

**Key Innovation**: Use Playwright MCP to interact with Appian's live expression editor for automated SAIL syntax validation - eliminating the biggest bottleneck in the current process.

**Workflow**:
1. **Initial Collaboration**: Designer + agent prioritize component backlog together
2. **Scheduled Generation**: 3 PRs/week (Mon/Wed/Fri) with pre-validated SAIL code
3. **Designer Review**: 2-3 days per PR for thorough feedback
4. **Learning Loop**: Monthly feedback integration to improve future generations

**Technical Approach**:
- Automated issue creation from Appian documentation gaps
- Multi-stage content generation (research → create → validate)
- Real-time MCP server sync for component status tracking
- Structured feedback collection with pattern recognition

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates syntax validation bottleneck through automated testing
- Maintains designer control while accelerating documentation creation
- Scales documentation coverage across full Appian component library
- Continuous improvement through feedback integration

**Timeline**: 9-week implementation across 4 phases, starting with validation pipeline and collaborative workflow setup.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Documentation Structure
- **Categories**: Components, Layouts, Patterns, Branding, Accessibility, Content Style Guide
- **Documentation Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter (status, last_updated)
- **Content Structure**: Design section (with variants/usage), Development section (with SAIL code)
- **Visual Elements**: Screenshots/images for design guidance
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility notes and code examples

### Workflow Strengths
- Clear separation between design and development guidance
- Consistent structure across documentation
- Integration with GitHub workflow (issues → PRs → reviews)
- Designer-centric review process

## Refined Workflow Ideas

### 1. Enhanced Issue Generation Strategy

**Problem**: Generic issues may not capture specific design system needs
**Solution**: Create issue templates with structured metadata

#### Issue Template Structure
```yaml
Component Type: [Input/Display/Navigation/Layout/Chart]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
Dependencies: [List existing components this depends on]
Use Cases: [Primary scenarios where this would be used]
Reference: [Link to Appian docs or similar pattern]
```

#### Automated Issue Creation
- Scan Appian SAIL components documentation
- Cross-reference with existing docs to identify gaps
- Generate prioritized backlog based on:
  - Component usage frequency
  - Design system completeness
  - User request patterns

### 2. Multi-Stage Agent Workflow

**Stage 1: Research & Analysis**
- Analyze Appian documentation for component

## Questions for Consideration

- Should we prioritize breadth (many simple components) or depth (fewer complex components)?
- How do we handle components that don't have direct Appian equivalents?
- What's the ideal balance between automation and human creativity?
- How do we ensure generated content maintains the design system's voice and tone?
- Should we implement A/B testing for different generation approaches?

## Feedback & Refinements

### 1. Documentation Index Synchronization
**Problem**: MCP server needs up-to-date information about documentation status
**Solution**: Implement bi-directional sync between docs and MCP server

#### Implementation Details
- **Real-time Updates**: Trigger MCP server index updates when docs are modified
- **Status Tracking**: Include completion status, last updated, and coverage metrics
- **Version Control**: Track documentation versions alongside component versions
- **Query Interface**: Allow MCP server to query current doc completeness and gaps

```yaml
# Example MCP Index Entry
component_id: "text_field"
status: "complete"
last_updated: "2024-12-15"
coverage:
  design_guidance: true
  code_examples: true
  accessibility: true
  variants: 3
dependencies: ["form_layout", "validation"]
```

### 2. Collaborative Prioritization & Scheduled Generation
**Problem**: Need to avoid overwhelming designers while maintaining momentum
**Solution**: Initial collaboration session + scheduled batch delivery

#### Workflow Structure
1. **Initial Collaboration Session**
   - Designer and agent review component backlog together
   - Prioritize based on user needs, design system gaps, and complexity
   - Set realistic timeline and batch sizes

2. **Scheduled Batch Generation**
   - 3 PRs per week maximum
   - Stagger releases: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
   - Each batch focuses on related components when possible
   - Designer has 2-3 days per PR for thorough review

3. **Feedback Integration Window**
   - Week 4 of each month: pause new generation
   - Focus on incorporating feedback into future generations
   - Refine templates and improve quality based on learnings

### 3. SAIL Syntax Validation via Live Expression Editor
**Problem**: No direct SAIL REPL access for syntax validation
**Solution**: Use Playwright MCP to interact with Appian's live expression editor

#### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Playwright automation for SAIL validation
async function validateSAILCode(sailCode) {
  // Navigate to live expression editor
  await page.goto('https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.2/sail/PageHeaders_MixAndMatchHeaderTypes.html');
  
  // Inject SAIL code into editor
  await page.fill('[data-testid="expression-editor"]', sailCode);
  
  // Check for syntax errors
  const errors = await page.locator('[data-testid="syntax-error"]').textContent();
  
  // Capture working example screenshot
  if (!errors) {
    await page.screenshot({ path: `validation-${componentId}.png` });
  }
  
  return {
    isValid: !errors,
    errors: errors || null,
    screenshot: !errors ? `validation-${componentId}.png` : null
  };
}
```

#### Validation Pipeline
1. **Pre-PR Validation**: Run all SAIL examples through live editor
2. **Error Capture**: Collect syntax errors and fix before PR creation
3. **Visual Verification**: Generate screenshots of working examples
4. **Regression Testing**: Re-validate existing examples when patterns change

### 4. Designer Feedback Integration System
**Problem**: Need to capture and apply designer feedback to improve future generations
**Solution**: Structured feedback collection and pattern recognition

#### Feedback Categories
```yaml
feedback_types:
  code_quality:
