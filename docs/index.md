# Design System Documentation

Welcome to our centralized, developer-accessible design system documentation platform that makes design guidance available directly within coding environments through AI assistants and other tools.

## Overview

This open-source repository serves as the single source of truth for our design system documentation, organized in a way that's both human-readable and machine-accessible through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Our goal is to bridge the gap between design guidance and development implementation, ensuring design system resources are accessible exactly when and where they're needed most.

## What's Inside

This design system documentation includes:

- **Components**: Individual UI components with usage guidelines and code examples
- **Patterns**: Reusable design patterns for common interface problems  
- **Layouts**: Page-level layout templates and structural guidance
- **Branding**: Core brand identity elements including colors, typography, and iconography
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive guidelines and checklists for inclusive design
- **Content Style Guide**: Guidelines for voice, tone, and content consistency

## Getting Started
