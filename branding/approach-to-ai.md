# Approach to AI

The UX of AI in Appian Solutions

## Overview

Appian Solutions will use a modified version of the Appian AI Copilot Brand for all AI components. The design is consistent and distinct so that the end-user can quickly identify when AI is being used.

## Colors

| Label | Default Color | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Header text | #08088D | |
| Iconography | #08088D | |
| Card Background - Blue | #F2F4FD | When card is against a white background or nested within a dialog box |
| Card Background - White | #FFFFFF | When card is against the default gray background |

## Imagery

Due to the "Sparkle" icon not being available externally, use a custom image uploaded to the system for the AI components.

### Sparkle Image - Dark

Use for small iconography

### Sparkle Image - Light

Use for larger, more illustrative elements

### Wizard Image

Reserve for marketing and sales slides, presentations and demos only. The light and dark stamps are an homage to the concept without using the explicit illustration.

### Usage Examples

Prompting the user to navigate to the AI Procedure Copilot from the Contract Writing landing page

Generate RFI modal for a Requirements Management demo

> **Helpful Tips**
>
> If an icon is needed and cannot be an image, the "magic" icon can be used

> **Accessibility**
>
> Alt-text is not needed as the image is entirely decorative

## Language

- Title the component "AI Copilot", feel free to add a secondary label to differentiate the functionality
- For example:
  - AI Copilot – Suggested Cases
  - AI Copilot – Comment Summary
- All AI elements should denote if they are using AI
- For generated content consider adding instructional text such as "Review generated content to make sure it's accurate and appropriate"
