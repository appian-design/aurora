## Usage Guidelines

- Use icons consistently throughout your application to maintain a cohesive user experience
- Select icons that clearly communicate their purpose without requiring additional explanation
- Ensure icons have sufficient contrast against their background
- Consider using color to enhance meaning (e.g., red for errors, green for success)
- Avoid using too many icons in close proximity as this can create visual clutter
- When using icons in buttons or interactive elements, include text labels when possible to improve accessibility
