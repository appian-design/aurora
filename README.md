# Appian Aurora Design System

[![Contributions Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

A centralized, developer-accessible design system documentation platform that makes design guidance available directly within coding environments through AI assistants and other tools.

## Overview

This open-source repository serves as the single source of truth for our design system documentation, organized in a way that's both human-readable and machine-accessible through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Our goal is to bridge the gap between design guidance and development implementation, ensuring design system resources are accessible exactly when and where they're needed most.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Documentation
Visit our [live documentation site](https://appian-design.github.io/aurora/) to explore the design system.

## 📚 What's Inside

This design system documentation includes:

- **Components**: Individual UI components with usage guidelines and code examples
- **Patterns**: Reusable design patterns for common interface problems
- **Layouts**: Page-level layout templates and structural guidance
- **Branding**: Core brand identity elements including colors, typography, and iconography
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive guidelines and checklists for inclusive design
- **Content Style Guide**: Guidelines for voice, tone, and content consistency

> **Note:** `docs/` remains the single source of truth for all documentation
> content and keeps its original file layout. Site generation (previously
> MkDocs, now Astro + Starlight) reads from it via a symlink at
> `src/content/docs`, so the paths watched by the MCP sync workflow
> (`.github/workflows/sync-mcp-metadata.yml`) are unaffected by this change.

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### Automated Maintenance

This repository uses automated workflows to help maintain the design system:

- **Monthly Issue Analysis**: Automated review of open issues to identify maintenance opportunities
- **AI-Assisted Implementation**: Support for AI agents to implement routine fixes and updates
- **Automated PR Creation**: PRs are automatically created when branches following the `aurora-agent/*` pattern are pushed

See our [Automated Maintenance Guide](.github/automated-maintenance.md) for details on how to use these workflows.

### MCP Server Integration

This repository is designed to work with the [Aurora MCP Server](https://github.com/appian-design/aurora-mcp) that makes documentation available directly within AI coding assistants. Changes made here are automatically synchronized with the MCP server through automated workflows, enabling:

- Real-time access to design system guidance within development environments
- AI-powered assistance with component selection and implementation
- Contextual design recommendations during coding

### AI Assistant Integration

For AI assistants working with this repository, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for guidance on documentation structure, formatting conventions, and best practices.
