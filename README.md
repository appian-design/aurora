# Appian Aurora Design System

[![Contributions Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

A centralized, developer-accessible design system documentation platform that makes design guidance available directly within coding environments through AI assistants and other tools.

## Overview

This open-source repository serves as the single source of truth for our design system documentation, organized in a way that's both human-readable and machine-accessible through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Our goal is to bridge the gap between design guidance and development implementation, ensuring design system resources are accessible exactly when and where they're needed most.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### MCP Server Integration

This repository is designed to work with the [Aurora MCP Server](https://github.com/appian-design/aurora-mcp) that makes documentation available directly within AI coding assistants. Changes made here are automatically synchronized with the MCP server through automated workflows, enabling:

- Real-time access to design system guidance within development environments
- AI-powered assistance with component selection and implementation
- Contextual design recommendations during coding

### AI Assistant Integration

For AI assistants working with this repository, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for guidance on documentation structure, formatting conventions, and best practices.

## 📝 File Formatting

All documentation files use Markdown with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
status: "stable"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
parent: "category-name"
related: ["related-item-1", "related-item-2"]
